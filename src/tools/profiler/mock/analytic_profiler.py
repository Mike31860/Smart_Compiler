        # Static code analysis (no runtime profiling)
        Code structure analysis:
        - Total lines: ~250 lines of code
        - 5 main functions identified
        - 3 classes with 12 methods
        
        Potential bottlenecks from static analysis:
        - Lines 45-52: Nested loop with O(nÂ²) complexity
        - Lines 78-85: Multiple file I/O operations without buffering
        - Lines 103-110: Recursive function with no memoization
        - Lines 157-165: Large string concatenation in a loop
        
        Resource usage predictions:
        - Memory: High allocation in data structures at lines 120-135
        - CPU: Compute-intensive operations at lines 103-110
        
        Optimization suggestions:
        1. Replace nested loop with more efficient algorithm
        2. Implement buffered I/O or use context managers
        3. Add memoization to recursive function
        4. Use string builders instead of concatenation
        5. Consider parallelizing independent operations
